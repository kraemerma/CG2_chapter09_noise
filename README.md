# CG2_chapter09_noise
by Mathias Kr√§mer

This is the repository for my cg2 presentation on 'noise' based on chapter 9 of David Wolff's 'OpenGL 4 Shading Language Cookbook, 3rd Edition'
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/OpenGL-4-Shading-Language-Cookbook-Third-Edition

The files 'scenenoise.cpp', 'noisetex.cpp' were edited for this project. The scene can be run by putting in the string 'noise' in the debug options.
